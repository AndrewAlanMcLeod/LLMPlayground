The code uses the `langchain` library to perform simple question-answering using the Hugging Face language model. 
The script sets the Hugging Face Hub API token and imports the necessary classes from the `langchain` library. 
It then initializes a Hugging Face model (`flan_t5`) with the Google Flan T5 XL repository and sets a model hyperparameter (`temperature`) to a very small value. 
A prompt template is built with a question placeholder, and the `LLMChain` object is instantiated with the prompt and the Hugging Face model. 
Finally, a question is defined and passed to the `run` method of the `LLMChain` object to get the answer, which is printed to the console.

import os

Set Hugging Face Hub API token
os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN'] = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'

from langchain import PromptTemplate, HuggingFaceHub, LLMChain

Initialize a Hugging Face model
flan_t5 = HuggingFaceHub(
repo_id="google/flan-t5-xl",
model_kwargs={"temperature":1e-10}
)

Build prompt template for simple question-answering
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: """
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

Instantiate a LLMChain object using the prompt and the Hugging Face model
llm_chain = LLMChain(
prompt=prompt,
llm=flan_t5
)

Define the question for which the answer is required
question = "Who is Wyndham Lewis?"

Use the LLMChain object to run the language model on the question and return the answer
print(llm_chain.run(question))
